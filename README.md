# Random Computational Stuff

Just a small collection of random things I’ve written and didn’t want to lose.

It is a mix of:
- **Functional programming snippets** (OCaml),
- **Old-school numerical or geometric tricks**,
- And some **ancient calculation methods** I have implemented in C++, just because I found them interesting.
- My first ever experiment with NN... Using financial theory still...

Nothing here is structured or part of a project, but simply a sandbox for ideas I find interesting (or nostalgic).  

Feel free to explore, but there’s no documentation, no dependencies list, and definitely no guarantee that any of this is “useful.”
